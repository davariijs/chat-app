### ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

#### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or later)
- npm or yarn

#### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/davariijs/chat-app.git
    cd chat-app
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    or
    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

3.  **Run the Socket.io server:**
    This server handles the real-time message broadcasting. Open a new terminal window and run:
    ```bash
    npm run dev:socket
    ```
    You should see the message: `üöÄ Socket.IO server is running on port 3001`

4.  **Run the Next.js development server:**
    In your original terminal window, run:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

5.  **Open the application:**
    Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result. The app will automatically redirect you to the first user's chat.

### üß™ Running Tests

This project uses Jest for unit testing the core logic.

-   **Run tests once:**
    ```bash
    npm test
    ```

-   **Run tests in watch mode:**
    This is great for development as it automatically re-runs tests on file changes.
    ```bash
    npm run test:watch
    ```

-   **Generate a test coverage report:**
    ```bash
    npm run test:coverage
    ```
